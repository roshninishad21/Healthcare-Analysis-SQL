# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-SQL
The Healthcare Project using MySQL focuses on building and analyzing a structured database to manage healthcare operations efficiently and derive actionable insights. The project involves working with patient records, doctor details, appointments, treatments, and billing data. Key aspects include:

Database Design:
> Creating relational tables for entities like patients, doctors, appointments, diagnoses, treatments, medications, and billing.
> Defining relationships (e.g., one-to-many between doctors and patients or appointments and treatments).

Data Management:
> Inserting, updating, and deleting data to reflect real-time scenarios like new patient registrations, appointment scheduling, and treatment updates.
> Ensuring data accuracy using constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.

Query-Based Analysis:
> Fetching patient demographics, medical history, and doctor assignments.
> Filtering and grouping data to analyze patient inflow, doctor availability, and common ailments.

Operational Insights:
> Identifying trends like most common diagnoses, frequently prescribed medications, and peak appointment times.
> Calculating metrics such as patient wait times, doctor workload, and revenue generated per department.

Advanced SQL Queries:
> Implementing aggregate functions (SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()) for metrics like total revenue or average patient age.
> Using nested queries and subqueries to find actionable insights (e.g., patients with recurring conditions or high-cost treatments).

This project highlights the role of MySQL in healthcare data management and analytics, showcasing its ability to streamline operations, improve patient care, and support strategic decision-making.
